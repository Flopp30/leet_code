# There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:
#
# ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
# --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
# Initially, the value of X is 0.
#
# Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations,
# return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
#
# Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
# Initially, X = 0.
# --X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
# X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
# X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
#
# Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
# Initially, X = 0.
# ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
# ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
# X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
#
# Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
# Initially, X = 0.
# X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
# ++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
# --X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
# X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
